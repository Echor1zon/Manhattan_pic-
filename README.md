# Manhattan_pic-
So, here is my attempt to implement some test project. Its aim was to bring 360 Manhattan projection of room to several 2d projections of exact walls of these rooms. I've been given datasets with coordinates of crucial polylines in a form of NumPY arrays, and source image. I used OpenCV library to process on image, and succeeded in cutting a fragment of exact wall. Due to lack of experience, i could not bring it to its real proportion by trasforming this fragment. 
I guess in future i'll surely finish it. Someday. 
p.s. it is in russian, so if you are HR, do not hesitate to contact me on t.me/rexaltat so I can describe my decisions.
